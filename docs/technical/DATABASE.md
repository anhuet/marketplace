## Schema Overview

The Marketplace database contains 9 entities that support user authentication, inventory management, peer-to-peer messaging, seller reputation, and push notification delivery.

```
users ──< listings ──< listing_images
  │           │
  │           └──< conversations ──< messages
  │           └──< reviews
  │
  ├──── invite_codes (1:1 created, N:1 redeemed)
  └──< push_tokens

categories ──< listings
```

**Key relationships**:
- `users` 1:1 `invite_codes` (created): each user may generate exactly one invite code
- `users` N:1 `invite_codes` (redeemed): many users may redeem the same invite code; each user records which code they used
- `users` 1:N `listings`: a seller owns many listings
- `listings` 1:N `listing_images`: each listing has ordered images
- `listings` 1:N `conversations`: a listing may have many buyer inquiries, each scoped to one buyer
- `conversations` 1:N `messages`: an ordered message thread within a conversation
- `listings` 1:N `reviews`: a completed transaction produces at most one review per direction
- `users` 1:N `push_tokens`: a user may be logged in on multiple devices
- `categories` 1:N `listings`: each listing belongs to one category

## Tables

---

### users

**Purpose**: Stores all registered user accounts. Auth0 is the credential authority; this table holds profile data and cached reputation metrics. A row is created on first successful Auth0 login.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------|
| id | uuid | PK, NOT NULL, DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() | Internal primary key |
| auth0_id | text | NOT NULL, UNIQUE | Auth0 `sub` claim — the permanent link between Auth0 and this record |
| email | text | NOT NULL, UNIQUE | User's email address — sourced from Auth0, kept in sync |
| display_name | text | NOT NULL | Publicly visible name chosen by the user |
| avatar_url | text | NULL | URL to profile image (hosted on CDN / S3) |
| bio | text | NULL | Optional free-text self-description |
| average_rating | float8 | NOT NULL, DEFAULT 0 | Cached mean of all `reviews.rating` values received. Updated by application on each new review — avoids aggregation on every profile read |
| rating_count | int4 | NOT NULL, DEFAULT 0 | Count of reviews received. Updated alongside `average_rating` |
| invite_code_used_id | uuid | FK → invite_codes.id, NULL | The invite code the user redeemed at registration. NULL for founding users seeded before invite enforcement. No UNIQUE constraint — multiple users may reference the same code |
| created_at | timestamptz | NOT NULL, DEFAULT now() | Record creation time |
| updated_at | timestamptz | NOT NULL, DEFAULT now() | Last modification time (managed by Prisma `@updatedAt`) |

**Indexes**:
- Implicit unique index on `auth0_id` — lookup on every authenticated request
- Implicit unique index on `email` — deduplication on registration
- Plain FK index on `invite_code_used_id` — supports lookups from users to their redeemed code (no uniqueness; Prisma does not generate this automatically, so it may need a manual `CREATE INDEX` if query volume warrants it)

**Relationships**:
- `invite_code_used_id` → `invite_codes.id` (no cascade — retain invite record if user is deleted)

**Notes**: Hard deletes are used. Listings and conversations should be anonymised or cascade-deleted before user deletion. `average_rating` and `rating_count` are denormalised for read performance — keep them consistent via the review creation transaction.

---

### invite_codes

**Purpose**: Stores user-generated invite codes that gate new registrations. Each user may generate exactly one code. Codes are reusable — there is no limit on how many users may redeem the same code, and no expiry.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------|
| id | uuid | PK, NOT NULL, DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() | Primary key |
| code | text | NOT NULL, UNIQUE | Human-readable invite string (e.g., `MKTPLACE-X7K2`) |
| created_by_id | uuid | NOT NULL, UNIQUE, FK → users.id | The user who generated this code. UNIQUE enforces one code per user |
| created_at | timestamptz | NOT NULL, DEFAULT now() | Code generation time |

**Indexes**:
- Implicit unique index on `code` — lookup during registration validation
- Implicit unique index on `created_by_id` — enforces one-code-per-user invariant

**Relationships**:
- `created_by_id` → `users.id` (no cascade — retain code history if creator is deleted)
- `users.invite_code_used_id` → `invite_codes.id` — the reverse pointer on the `users` table records which code each user redeemed

**Notes**: The `used_at` column has been removed (migration `20260520000000_multi_use_invite_codes`). Codes are now unlimited-use — the only database-enforced invariant remaining is one code generated per user (UNIQUE on `created_by_id`). The many redeemers of a code are discoverable by querying `users WHERE invite_code_used_id = $codeId`. There is no `used_by_id` column on this table; the relationship is owned by `users` to avoid a circular FK dependency.

---

### categories

**Purpose**: Reference table of listing categories. Seeded at deploy time; not user-editable in v1.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------|
| id | uuid | PK, NOT NULL, DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() | Primary key |
| name | text | NOT NULL, UNIQUE | Human-readable category name (e.g., "Electronics") |
| slug | text | NOT NULL, UNIQUE | URL-safe identifier (e.g., "electronics") |

**Indexes**:
- Implicit unique index on `name`
- Implicit unique index on `slug` — used in API filtering

**Notes**: No `created_at` column — this is a static reference table. Seed data should be applied in the initial migration.

---

### listings

**Purpose**: Core inventory entity. Represents an item a seller is offering for sale. Supports GPS-based discovery via `latitude` / `longitude` float columns.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------|
| id | uuid | PK, NOT NULL, DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() | Primary key |
| title | text | NOT NULL | Short listing headline |
| description | text | NOT NULL | Full item description |
| price | numeric(10,2) | NOT NULL | Asking price. Decimal type prevents floating-point rounding errors on currency |
| condition | enum Condition | NOT NULL | Item condition: NEW, LIKE_NEW, GOOD, FAIR, POOR |
| status | enum ListingStatus | NOT NULL, DEFAULT 'ACTIVE' | Listing lifecycle: ACTIVE, SOLD, DELETED |
| latitude | float8 | NOT NULL | WGS-84 latitude of the listing location. Used in Haversine distance queries |
| longitude | float8 | NOT NULL | WGS-84 longitude of the listing location. Used in Haversine distance queries |
| category_id | uuid | NOT NULL, FK → categories.id | The category this listing belongs to |
| seller_id | uuid | NOT NULL, FK → users.id | The user selling this item |
| created_at | timestamptz | NOT NULL, DEFAULT now() | Listing creation time |
| updated_at | timestamptz | NOT NULL, DEFAULT now() | Last modification time |

**Indexes**:
- `idx_listings_lat_lng` on `(latitude, longitude)` — supports bounding-box pre-filter in Haversine queries. Not sufficient alone for distance ordering; the application applies the Haversine formula in the WHERE/ORDER BY clause using raw SQL
- `idx_listings_status` on `(status)` — filters active listings efficiently; low cardinality but the ACTIVE bucket is the dominant query pattern
- `idx_listings_seller_id` on `(seller_id)` — fetch all listings by a seller for profile pages
- `idx_listings_category_id` on `(category_id)` — filter listings by category

**Relationships**:
- `seller_id` → `users.id` (no cascade — listings should be retained or anonymised if a seller is deleted)
- `category_id` → `categories.id` (no cascade)
- `listing_images` ON DELETE CASCADE — images are owned by the listing
- `conversations` — no cascade; conversations should be retained for audit
- `reviews` — no cascade; reviews should be retained for audit

**Notes**: `status = 'DELETED'` is a soft delete — the row is retained for referential integrity (conversations and reviews reference it). Queries for active inventory must include `WHERE status = 'ACTIVE'`. A partial index on `(latitude, longitude) WHERE status = 'ACTIVE'` would be more efficient but adds migration complexity; can be added in a future optimisation pass once query patterns are confirmed from production. PostGIS upgrade path: enable the `postgis` extension on the RDS instance and add a `location GEOGRAPHY(Point, 4326) GENERATED ALWAYS AS (ST_MakePoint(longitude, latitude)) STORED` column in a future migration.

---

### listing_images

**Purpose**: Stores ordered image URLs for a listing. Separated from `listings` to support multiple images without array columns.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------|
| id | uuid | PK, NOT NULL, DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() | Primary key |
| listing_id | uuid | NOT NULL, FK → listings.id ON DELETE CASCADE | The owning listing |
| url | text | NOT NULL | Fully-qualified URL to the image (CDN / S3 pre-signed URL) |
| order | int4 | NOT NULL, DEFAULT 0 | Display order. Lower values appear first. The first image (order=0) is the cover photo |
| created_at | timestamptz | NOT NULL, DEFAULT now() | Upload time |

**Indexes**:
- `idx_listing_images_listing_id` on `(listing_id)` — fetch all images for a listing

**Relationships**:
- `listing_id` → `listings.id` (ON DELETE CASCADE — images are deleted when their listing is hard-deleted)

**Notes**: Soft-deleted listings (`status = 'DELETED'`) retain their images. The `order` column is application-managed; the backend must validate uniqueness of order values per listing if strict ordering is required.

---

### conversations

**Purpose**: Represents a buyer's inquiry thread about a specific listing. A conversation is scoped to exactly one listing and one buyer; the seller is derived via `listings.seller_id`.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------|
| id | uuid | PK, NOT NULL, DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() | Primary key |
| listing_id | uuid | NOT NULL, FK → listings.id | The listing being enquired about |
| buyer_id | uuid | NOT NULL, FK → users.id | The prospective buyer initiating the conversation |
| created_at | timestamptz | NOT NULL, DEFAULT now() | Conversation creation time |
| updated_at | timestamptz | NOT NULL, DEFAULT now() | Updated when a new message is added (application-managed) |

**Indexes**:
- Implicit unique index on `(listing_id, buyer_id)` — enforces one conversation per buyer per listing; also serves as the lookup index for this common access pattern
- `idx_conversations_buyer_id` on `(buyer_id)` — fetch all conversations for a buyer's inbox

**Relationships**:
- `listing_id` → `listings.id` (no cascade)
- `buyer_id` → `users.id` (no cascade)
- `messages` ON DELETE CASCADE — messages are owned by the conversation

**Notes**: The seller's identity is not stored directly on this table. To retrieve the seller, JOIN to `listings` and read `listings.seller_id`. The UNIQUE constraint on `(listing_id, buyer_id)` means the application can safely upsert to find-or-create a conversation.

---

### messages

**Purpose**: Individual messages within a conversation. Supports unread tracking via `read_at`.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------|
| id | uuid | PK, NOT NULL, DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() | Primary key |
| conversation_id | uuid | NOT NULL, FK → conversations.id ON DELETE CASCADE | The parent conversation |
| sender_id | uuid | NOT NULL | The user who sent the message. Not a FK with cascade to retain messages if sender is deleted |
| content | text | NOT NULL | Message body |
| read_at | timestamptz | NULL | Timestamp when the recipient read the message. NULL = unread |
| created_at | timestamptz | NOT NULL, DEFAULT now() | Message send time |

**Indexes**:
- `idx_messages_conversation_id` on `(conversation_id)` — fetch message thread; combined with ORDER BY created_at
- `idx_messages_sender_id` on `(sender_id)` — lookup messages by sender (used for moderation)

**Relationships**:
- `conversation_id` → `conversations.id` (ON DELETE CASCADE — messages deleted when conversation is deleted)

**Notes**: `read_at` tracks per-message read state. Unread count is computed as `COUNT(*) WHERE read_at IS NULL AND sender_id != <current_user_id>`. A partial index on `(conversation_id) WHERE read_at IS NULL` can be added if unread-count queries become a bottleneck.

---

### reviews

**Purpose**: Post-transaction seller reviews. A buyer submits a review of the seller after a sale is marked complete. The unique constraint enforces one review per direction per listing.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------|
| id | uuid | PK, NOT NULL, DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() | Primary key |
| listing_id | uuid | NOT NULL, FK → listings.id | The listing the transaction relates to |
| reviewer_id | uuid | NOT NULL, FK → users.id | The user writing the review (buyer) |
| reviewee_id | uuid | NOT NULL, FK → users.id | The user being reviewed (seller) |
| rating | int4 | NOT NULL | Score 1–5. Application layer validates the range; a CHECK constraint can be added: `CHECK (rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5)` |
| comment | text | NULL | Optional written feedback |
| created_at | timestamptz | NOT NULL, DEFAULT now() | Review submission time |

**Indexes**:
- Implicit unique index on `(listing_id, reviewer_id, reviewee_id)` — prevents duplicate reviews and doubles as a lookup index
- `idx_reviews_reviewee_id` on `(reviewee_id)` — fetch all reviews for a seller's profile page

**Relationships**:
- `listing_id` → `listings.id` (no cascade — retain reviews for audit)
- `reviewer_id` → `users.id` (no cascade)
- `reviewee_id` → `users.id` (no cascade)

**Notes**: After inserting a review, the application must update `users.average_rating` and `users.rating_count` for the reviewee within the same transaction. Formula: `new_average = ((old_average * old_count) + new_rating) / (old_count + 1)`. The `rating` range (1–5) is currently enforced by the application layer. Adding `@@check("rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5")` at the database level is recommended as a future hardening step.

---

### push_tokens

**Purpose**: Stores Expo push notification tokens per device. A user may have tokens for multiple devices (phone + tablet, iOS reinstall, etc.). Stale tokens are purged when Expo returns a `DeviceNotRegistered` error.

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------|
| id | uuid | PK, NOT NULL, DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() | Primary key |
| user_id | uuid | NOT NULL, FK → users.id ON DELETE CASCADE | The owning user |
| token | text | NOT NULL, UNIQUE | Expo push token (e.g., `ExponentPushToken[xxx]`). UNIQUE prevents duplicate registrations |
| platform | enum Platform | NOT NULL | IOS or ANDROID — used to tailor notification payload if needed |
| created_at | timestamptz | NOT NULL, DEFAULT now() | Token registration time |
| updated_at | timestamptz | NOT NULL, DEFAULT now() | Last seen / re-registered time |

**Indexes**:
- Implicit unique index on `token` — deduplicates registration upserts
- `idx_push_tokens_user_id` on `(user_id)` — fetch all tokens for a user when sending a notification

**Relationships**:
- `user_id` → `users.id` (ON DELETE CASCADE — tokens deleted when user is deleted)

**Notes**: Token registration should be an upsert (`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (token) DO UPDATE SET updated_at = now(), user_id = $userId`). When Expo returns `DeviceNotRegistered`, the token row must be deleted immediately to avoid wasted push calls.

## Enums

| Enum | Values | Used by |
|------|--------|---------|
| `ListingStatus` | ACTIVE, SOLD, DELETED | `listings.status` |
| `Condition` | NEW, LIKE_NEW, GOOD, FAIR, POOR | `listings.condition` |
| `Platform` | IOS, ANDROID | `push_tokens.platform` |

## Migrations Log

| Migration File | Date | Description | Reversible | Deployment Risk |
|----------------|------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| `20260410170133_initial_schema` | 2026-04-10 | Full initial schema: all 9 tables, enums, indexes, FK constraints | Yes | None — new database, no existing data |
| `20260421000000_add_saved_listings` | 2026-04-21 | Add `saved_listings` table for bookmarking listings | Yes — drop table | None — additive change |
| `20260421100000_add_buyer_to_listing` | 2026-04-21 | Add nullable `buyer_id` column to `listings` | Yes — drop column | None — additive change |
| `20260520000000_multi_use_invite_codes` | 2026-05-20 | Drop UNIQUE index on `users.invite_code_used_id`; drop `used_at` column from `invite_codes` — codes are now unlimited-use | Partial — index can be recreated; `used_at` data is permanently lost (4 rows affected in production) | Low — `DROP INDEX` is fast; `DROP COLUMN` acquires a brief ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock but completes in milliseconds on a small table |

---

## Common Query Patterns

### 1. Nearby listings (Haversine bounding box + distance filter)

Prisma does not support Haversine natively. Use `$queryRaw` with a raw SQL query. The bounding-box index pre-filter (`latitude BETWEEN` / `longitude BETWEEN`) reduces the candidate set before the more expensive trigonometric calculation.

```sql
-- $1 = centre latitude, $2 = centre longitude, $3 = radius in km
SELECT
  l.id,
  l.title,
  l.price,
  l.latitude,
  l.longitude,
  (
    6371 * acos(
      cos(radians($1)) * cos(radians(l.latitude))
      * cos(radians(l.longitude) - radians($2))
      + sin(radians($1)) * sin(radians(l.latitude))
    )
  ) AS distance_km
FROM listings l
WHERE
  l.status = 'ACTIVE'
  AND l.latitude  BETWEEN ($1 - $3 / 111.0) AND ($1 + $3 / 111.0)
  AND l.longitude BETWEEN ($2 - $3 / (111.0 * cos(radians($1)))) AND ($2 + $3 / (111.0 * cos(radians($1))))
HAVING
  (
    6371 * acos(
      cos(radians($1)) * cos(radians(l.latitude))
      * cos(radians(l.longitude) - radians($2))
      + sin(radians($1)) * sin(radians(l.latitude))
    )
  ) <= $3
ORDER BY distance_km ASC
LIMIT 50;
```

Uses `idx_listings_lat_lng` and `idx_listings_status` for the pre-filter.

### 2. Unread message count per conversation

```sql
-- $1 = conversation_id, $2 = current user_id (the reader)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS unread_count
FROM messages
WHERE
  conversation_id = $1
  AND sender_id   != $2
  AND read_at     IS NULL;
```

Uses `idx_messages_conversation_id`. A partial index on `(conversation_id) WHERE read_at IS NULL` should be considered if this query runs at high frequency.

### 3. User's conversations with last message (inbox view)

```sql
-- $1 = current user_id
SELECT
  c.id            AS conversation_id,
  c.listing_id,
  l.title         AS listing_title,
  l.status        AS listing_status,
  limg.url        AS listing_cover_image,
  m.content       AS last_message,
  m.created_at    AS last_message_at,
  m.sender_id     AS last_message_sender_id,
  (
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM messages unread
    WHERE unread.conversation_id = c.id
      AND unread.sender_id != $1
      AND unread.read_at IS NULL
  ) AS unread_count
FROM conversations c
JOIN listings l        ON l.id = c.listing_id
LEFT JOIN listing_images limg
  ON limg.listing_id = c.listing_id
  AND limg."order"   = 0
JOIN LATERAL (
  SELECT content, created_at, sender_id
  FROM messages
  WHERE conversation_id = c.id
  ORDER BY created_at DESC
  LIMIT 1
) m ON true
WHERE c.buyer_id = $1
   OR l.seller_id = $1
ORDER BY m.created_at DESC;
```

Uses `idx_conversations_buyer_id` for the buyer branch. The LATERAL join retrieves the last message efficiently using `idx_messages_conversation_id`.

### 4. Update average rating after a new review (run in same transaction as INSERT into reviews)

```sql
-- $1 = new rating value (integer 1-5), $2 = reviewee user_id
UPDATE users
SET
  rating_count   = rating_count + 1,
  average_rating = ((average_rating * rating_count) + $1) / (rating_count + 1),
  updated_at     = now()
WHERE id = $2;
```

This must execute within the same database transaction as the `INSERT INTO reviews` to keep `average_rating` / `rating_count` consistent. If the transaction rolls back, neither the review nor the rating update is persisted.

---

## Key Design Decisions

### Auth0 as credential authority
Auth0 is the source of truth for passwords, MFA, and session tokens. The `auth0_id` column (`auth0_sub` claim) is the stable link between the Auth0 user record and this database. The `email` column is kept in sync from Auth0 claims on each login — it is not the primary lookup key. If an Auth0 user is deleted and recreated, a new `auth0_id` means a new DB user row.

### Latitude / longitude as Float columns
PostGIS is not assumed to be available on all RDS tiers. `latitude` and `longitude` are stored as `float8` (double precision) — sufficient for sub-metre accuracy. GPS queries use the Haversine formula in raw SQL with a bounding-box pre-filter. PostGIS upgrade path: enable the `postgis` extension on the RDS instance and add a `GEOGRAPHY(Point, 4326)` column derived from the existing float columns in a future additive migration. The float columns would be retained during transition.

### Cached rating fields on users
`average_rating` and `rating_count` are denormalised onto the `users` table. Recomputing them from `reviews` on every profile read is expensive and grows with the user's transaction history. The trade-off is that both fields must be updated atomically in the same transaction as a new review. Any bug that inserts a review without updating the cache produces drift — monitor with a periodic reconciliation job: `SELECT reviewee_id, COUNT(*), AVG(rating) FROM reviews GROUP BY reviewee_id`.

### Invite code ownership model
Codes are **multi-use** (unlimited redemptions, no expiry). There are two relationships:

1. **Creator**: owned by `invite_codes.created_by_id` (UNIQUE FK → `users`). Enforces that every user generates at most one code.
2. **Redeemer**: owned by `users.invite_code_used_id` (plain nullable FK → `invite_codes`). Records which code each user redeemed at registration. There is no UNIQUE constraint here, so any number of users may reference the same code. NULL means the user was seeded before invite enforcement.

The `used_at` timestamp that previously marked a code as "consumed" was dropped in migration `20260520000000_multi_use_invite_codes`. The remaining database-enforced invariant is: one code generated per user (UNIQUE on `created_by_id`). Rate limiting and abuse prevention for code reuse must be handled at the application layer if needed in future — there is deliberately no DB-level counter or max-use ceiling.

To find all users who redeemed a specific code: `SELECT id, display_name FROM users WHERE invite_code_used_id = $codeId`.

### Conversations uniqueness
The UNIQUE constraint on `(listing_id, buyer_id)` in `conversations` means the API can safely use an upsert to find-or-create a conversation, and duplicate conversation creation by the client is idempotent. The seller identity is not duplicated onto the conversation row — it is resolved via `listings.seller_id`.

### Soft deletes on listings only
Only listings use a soft delete (`status = 'DELETED'`). Users, conversations, messages, and reviews use hard deletes (with appropriate cascade rules). Listing soft deletes preserve referential integrity for conversations and reviews that reference the listing after it is taken down.

### Review direction uniqueness
The UNIQUE constraint on `(listing_id, reviewer_id, reviewee_id)` permits two reviews per listing (buyer reviews seller, and potentially seller reviews buyer in future) without allowing duplicates in either direction. In v1 only the buyer-reviews-seller direction is implemented.

## Known Issues and Tech Debt

| Issue | Impact | Plan |
|-------|--------|------|
| No CHECK constraint on `reviews.rating` range | Invalid rating values (e.g., 0, 6) can be inserted if application validation is bypassed | Add `CHECK (rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5)` in a future migration |
| `latitude`/`longitude` as float columns | Haversine queries require raw SQL; no spatial indexing | PostGIS upgrade path documented above |
| `average_rating` cache drift risk | A bug in review creation can desync cached fields | Add periodic reconciliation job; consider a DB trigger as a safety net |
| No partial index for active listing geo-queries | `idx_listings_lat_lng` indexes all rows including SOLD/DELETED | Add `WHERE status = 'ACTIVE'` partial index once query volume justifies it |
